suggestions for improvement:
- The form's `action` attribute is set to `index.html`, which is unnecessary and might cause unexpected behavior.  It should be either removed or set to a proper handler.  Currently, it does not submit the form data to the server, which is expected behavior for this task.
- The code lacks error handling.  It should gracefully handle cases where the user doesn't enter data in both input fields.
- Use `addEventListener` instead of relying on the form's default submit behavior. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- Add labels for better accessibility.
- Improve styling to match the image's output more closely (e.g., add a `<pre>` tag to format the JSON output).

suggestions for improvement:
- The code could be slightly improved by using `const` for `formData` to indicate that it's not reassigned after creation.
- Adding error handling (e.g., checking if name and lastName fields are filled) would enhance user experience.
