suggestions for improvement:
- The error messages could be more descriptive, providing more context (e.g., specifying the index of the non-string element in `makeAllCaps`).
- For better performance with very large arrays, consider using more efficient sorting algorithms than the default `sort()` (e.g., merge sort or quicksort) in `sortWords`.

suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling in `joinWords` to provide more specific error messages to the user, potentially showing an error message on the page instead of just logging it to the console.
- Add input validation to `toMorse` to handle cases where the user enters only whitespace or an empty string.
- Consider using a more user-friendly method for displaying the Morse code translation on the page instead of using `<br>`. For instance, you could style each Morse code sequence within its own div or span element for better visual separation and control.
- The `toMorse` function currently only handles lowercase input.  Adding a check that converts input to lowercase, but retains any original capitalization in the output would be an improvement.
