suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Consider adding a more descriptive message in the resolve/reject, perhaps indicating that the number is successfully compared or the comparison failed.
- While functionally correct, the comments could be slightly improved for even better readability. For example, instead of `// the promise resolves if the argument is less than or equal to 10`, consider `// Resolve the promise if the number is less than or equal to 10`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is already quite readable.  Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the `promise` variable for enhanced clarity.
- While the performance is good for this specific task, for more complex scenarios, exploring alternative async/await methods might improve overall code structure and readability.
