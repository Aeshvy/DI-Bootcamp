suggestions for improvement:
- The `usernames` and `highScorePlayers` functions currently use `console.log` to output the results instead of returning arrays as specified in the instructions.  They should return new arrays containing the modified usernames and high-scoring usernames, respectively.
- Use `map()` instead of `forEach` for creating new arrays based on existing arrays. This is more functional and readable.
- The code should explicitly return the total score calculation instead of just printing it to the console.
Correctness: 60%
