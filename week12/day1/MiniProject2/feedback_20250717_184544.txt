suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling: Provide more user-friendly error messages, potentially specifying the type of error (e.g., network error, API error) and suggesting actions.
- Add input validation:  More robust input validation for the amount field (e.g., allowing only numbers with a certain number of decimal places).
- Enhance UI/UX: Consider adding visual feedback during API calls (e.g., a loading indicator), and improve the styling of the result display.
- Optimize API calls:  Batch the currency code fetching and conversion rate fetching if possible. Currently, it makes two API calls, one for codes and one for conversion.
- Add better API key handling: The API key is hardcoded. Consider using environment variables or a more secure method to manage it.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement proper error handling for API requests (e.g., network errors, invalid API keys).  Display user-friendly messages instead of letting the application crash or show cryptic errors.
- Add input validation to ensure the amount entered is a valid number.
- Improve the UI with better styling and potentially a more user-friendly layout.
- Consider using a JavaScript framework or library (like React, Vue, or Angular) for a more structured and maintainable codebase, especially for larger applications.
- The API key should be stored securely; avoid hardcoding it directly into the client-side JavaScript code.
