# üåü Exercise 4 : Random

# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100. Use the random module.
# Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

import random

def number(num):
    if 1 >= num >=100:
        print("Pick number between 1 and 100.")

    random_num = random.randrange(1,100)

    if num == random_num:
        print("It's a match!")
    else:
        print(f"Your number was: {num}, and the winning number is: {random_num}. Better luck next time!")

user_num = int(input('Pick a number between 1 and 100: '))
number(user_num)

def make_shirt(size='large', text='I love Python'):
    print(f'The size of the shirt is {size}, and the text is: "{text}."')


def make_shirts(size, text='I love Python'):
