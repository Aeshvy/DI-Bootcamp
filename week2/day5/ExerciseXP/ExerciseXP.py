# üåü Exercise 1: Cats

# Using this class

class Cat():
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age


# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
cat1 = Cat('Peter', 41)
cat2 = Cat('Joe', 46)
cat3 = Cat('Quagmire', 38)

# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
def find_oldest_cat(cats):
    return max(cats, key=lambda cat: cat.age)

cats = [cat1, cat2, cat3]

oldest_cat = find_oldest_cat(cats)

# Print the following string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù. Use the function previously created.
print(f"The oldest is {oldest_cat.name}, he is {oldest_cat.age} years old. Damn, that's like really old!")

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs

# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
class Dog():
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height
        pass

# Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
    def bark(self):
        return(f'{self.name} goes woof!')

# Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.
    def jump(self):
        h = self.height * 2
        return(f'{self.name} jumps {h} cm high!')

# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
davids_dog = Dog('Rex', 50)

# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
print(davids_dog.bark())
print(davids_dog.jump())

# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
sarahs_dog = Dog('Teacup', 20)

# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
print(sarahs_dog.bark())
print(sarahs_dog.jump())

# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.
if davids_dog.height > sarahs_dog.height:
    print(f"The bigger dog is {davids_dog.name}.")
else:
    print(f"The bigger dog is {sarahs_dog.name}.")

# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs the song producer?

# 1. Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
class Song():
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics

# 2. Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for line in self.lyrics:
            print(line)

# 3. Create an object, for example:
stairway = Song(["There's a lady who's sure", 
                 "all that glitters is gold", 
                 "and she's buying a stairway to heaven"])

# 4. Call the sing_me_a_song method.
stairway.sing_me_a_song()

# üåü Exercise 4 : Afternoon at the Zoo


# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
class Zoo():
    def __init__(self, zoo_name):
        self.zoo_name = zoo_name
        self.animals = []
        pass

zoo1 = Zoo("Alpha Zoo")
zoo2 = Zoo("Omega Zoo")

def add_animal(self, new_animal):
        if new_animal not in self.animals:
            self.animals.append(new_animal)
            print(f"{new_animal} added to {self.zoo_name}.")
        else:
            print(f"{new_animal} is already in the zoo.")
    

# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn‚Äôt already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
