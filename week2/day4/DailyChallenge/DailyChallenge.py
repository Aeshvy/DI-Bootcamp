# ðŸŒŸ Challenge 1 : Sorting

# Instructions
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Use List Comprehension


# Example:

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be: bag,hello,without,world

user_input = input("Enter a comma-separated sequence of words: ")

sorted_sequence = ','.join([word.strip() for word in sorted(user_input.split(','))])

print("Sorted sequence:", sorted_sequence)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ðŸŒŸ Challenge 2 : Longest Word

# Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. If two or more words are found, return the first longest word.
# Characters such as apostrophe, comma, period count as part of the word (e.g. Oâ€™Connor is 8 characters long).

# Examples:

# longest_word("Margaret's toy is a pretty doll.") âžž "Margaret's"
# longest_word("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") âžž "forever."
# longest_word("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") âžž "Forgetfulness"
